  The US AI Equity Options Total Return Index is a model-driven index designed to measure the performance of 
  an actively managed options strategy applied to large-cap U.S. equities with a strong focus on technology, 
  artificial intelligence, and innovation-driven companies. The index reflects a systematic approach that 
  combines equity exposure with options strategies, primarily premium-selling structures such as cash-secured 
  puts and covered calls, supplemented by selective long-option positions. The objective of the index is to 
  generate attractive risk-adjusted total returns over a full market cycle while seeking to outperform broad 
  U.S. technology benchmarks over the long term.

	<p style="opacity:.7;">
  The index methodology emphasizes disciplined risk management and capital efficiency. Positions are diversified 
  across multiple liquid U.S. equities and exchange-traded instruments, with all options strategies defined-risk
  by construction. The index does not use margin borrowing and avoids strategies with unlimited loss potential. 
  Rebalancing and adjustments are performed based on market conditions, volatility, time decay, and option pricing 
  dynamics, rather than short-term market predictions. The index value represents the theoretical performance of 
  the strategy and is calculated net of option premiums received and losses incurred, but excludes transaction
  costs, taxes, and slippage unless otherwise stated.
